 <h2>Vowels</h2>
    <p>In Thai there are 32 vowels. However, there are 28 main vowel forms. The 4 we don’t learn anymore, but can be seen in old textbooks are as follows:
1. ฤ – Re

2. ฤา – Reh

3. ฦ – Re

4. ฦา – Rerh

Note: it is very difficult to find equivalent sounding words for the above vowels in English.

Don’t worry about these for now. Learn the main 28 as in my chart below.

Now, not all vowel forms follow consonants; some appear above consonants and some below. Complex form vowels — composed of more than one part — can be placed around the consonant(s).

Vowels are separated into short and long.There are 14 long vowels and 18 short vowels. For example, the first vowel is sara ‘a’ (short), followed by the long version sara ‘ar’.</p>

   <h2>Tones</h2>
    <p>Thai is a tonal language, and the script gives full information on the tones. Tones are realised in the vowels, but indicated in the script by a combination of the class of the initial consonant (high, mid or low), vowel length (long or short), closing consonant (plosive or sonorant, i.e., dead or live) and, if present, one of four tone marks, whose name derive from the name of the digits 1–4 borrowed from Pali or Sanskrit. The rules for denoting tones are shown in the following chart:</p>
